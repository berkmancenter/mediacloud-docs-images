# Media Cloud documentation images

Kept as a separate repository and used as a submodule in the [main project](https://github.com/mediacloud/backend) so that the main repo doesn't become too big from all the binary images.

If this repo grows too large, feel free to remove everything or rewrite history with `--force` to get rid of all the binary blobs.

Consider running `./pngcrush.sh` script to reduce size of PNG images before committing.
